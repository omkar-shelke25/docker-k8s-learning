# Kubernetes: An Open-Source Platform for Containerized Applications

- Kubernetes is an open-source platform that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. While containers can be run on any Linux system using tools like Podman or Docker, these tools lack the ability to automatically scale based on workload or restart containers after failure. Kubernetes addresses these challenges.

- Kubernetes manages applications across a cluster of nodes. If a node fails, Kubernetes can automatically restart the application on another node, ensuring high availability.

- One of the key features of Kubernetes is its declarative configuration model. Administrators define the desired state of the workloads in the cluster, including the amount of memory required. Kubernetes then schedules the necessary containers across the nodes to meet these requirements.

- Workloads in Kubernetes are defined in terms of Pods. A pod can contain one or multiple containers that run on the same node. Pods with multiple containers are useful when containers need to share resources. For instance, a job in Kubernetes is a workload that runs a task within a pod until completion.

- Kubernetes also allows users to define how applications should run and interact with other applications or the external world. It supports scaling services up or down, rolling out updates, and rolling them back in case of failure, all while maintaining the required number of instances at all times.
